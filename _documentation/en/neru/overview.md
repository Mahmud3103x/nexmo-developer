# Overview (WIP)

NeRu eliminates the need to maintain your own infrastructure to use the Vonage APIs. The platform has multiple different APIs including voice, messaging, data persistence, scheduling, and more. The flexibility of the platform is a perfect fit for building use cases such as voice and message notifications, IVRs, and chatbots.

NeRu offers user friendly tooling to develop an app including a [debugger](/neru/debugging.md), templates, and samples. Checkout the [Get started with NeRu](/neru/tutorials/neru-get-started) tutorial to learn more about how to develop with NeRu.
